# Image Classification

The train data consists of 20000 images, belonging to 10 different classes. The task is to train a convolutional neural net in keras for this multi-class classification. The purpose here is to get familiar with image data format, working with images, building the training dataset, Convolutional Architectures, Keras API & hyper parameters and their tuning.
